Folder `Codes` contains all the python notebook that used to create the matirals in the lectures.

Folder `Animation` contains the animation used in the slides and lost when it converted to pdf.

The course covers basics of classical and quantum machine learning methods as
* `Lecture_1.pdf` Overview about recent classical and quantum machine learning algorithms in HEP.
* `Lecture_2.pdf` Introduction to ML, linear and non-linear regression models.
* `Lecture_3.pdf` Ensemble learning, decision trees, boosted decision tress and random forest.
* `Lecture_4.pdf` Introduction to deep learning and feed forward deep neural network.
* `Lecture_5.pdf` Convolution based neural network for image recognition.
* `Lecture_6.pdf` Introduction to quantum machine learning, quantum gates, quantum feature map, data encoding and VQCs.
